On January 14, 2025 at 03:00 AM, María Espinoza, the Chief Department Ges Complex networks and programmatic lines., attended a in person meeting via Monjitas 565, 9th floor
From Fresenius Care, the following history of the meeting are presented.
- General pocket spending data is reported that must be assumed by users and their families, associated with the cost in transportation for retreat. The meeting lasted 1 horas, 0 minutos and focused on the Design, implementation and evaluation of policies, plans and programs carried out by the taxpayers..

**Purpose:**
Meeting request to present pilot plan for the benefit of patients with home enteral nutrition. <Br />
Estimated Andrea: <Br />
My name is Barbara Cabrera, head of access to markets in Fresenius Kabi, one of the main suppliers of enteral nutrition for beneficiaries of Ricarte Soto law. I allow myself to address you to request a meeting with the objective of presenting a pilot plan that we have developed to benefit 100 patients from 6 health institutions who require enteral nutrition. <Br />
Currently, these patients should remove more than 30 kilos of product monthly and transport them by their own means to their homes, which generates a considerable load and a pocket expense for the family. Our pilot plan proposes to incorporate a direct transfer service to the patient's home, complemented with personalized clinical monitoring to guarantee the continuity and effectiveness of the treatment and thus support the network institutions in their daily work. <Br />
In addition, one of the main strengths of this program is that it does not represent an additional cost, and its expectation is that it can be lavished progressively nationwide, expanding the benefit to a greater number of patients in similar conditions. <Br />
We are convinced that this project can transform the experience of patients, simplify their access to treatments and improve their quality of life, so we consider the participation and support of the Ministry of Health for its implementation and initial evaluation. <Br />
We are attentive to its availability to coordinate this meeting, either in person or virtual, as they consider more convenient. <Br />
Thanking in advance your attention and interest, I remain at your disposal to expand any detail or provide additional information. <Br />
Sincerely, <Br />
Bárbara Cabrera Leyton.

**Purpose:**
New listings of active ingredients that must demonstrate bioequivalence. Implications for the local pharmaceutical industry <Br />
<Br />
Topics addressed in meeting: <Br />
Consultations are made on the following subjects associated with EQT/Therapeutic equivalence certification.  <Br />
<Br />
1. Molecules selection criteria to which they have been given in the last decree (D. Ex. MINSAL N ° 69/2024): It is indicated that the product selection study was carried out from those who already had a reference designation (231 p.a associated with a pharmaceutical and release form, established in the D. Ex. MINSAL N ° 51/2023 and N ° 8/ Employees were multiple, especially considering the degrees of progress in certification for each P.A. and formulation that is intended to submit to the demand; the market, consumption and access situation; The incorporation of these into some public health strategy such as GES or similar; and the essentiality of the product. However, it is indicated that special care was taken that the demand did not affect relevant markets and the availability of products.  Likewise, it is noted that the requirement of EQT for solid pharmaceutical forms is long and approximately advanced over 2/3 of the total products; and the current requirement, incorporated by D. Ex. MINSAL N ° 69/2024 is focused on advancing in the last third, where there are mostly products of recent introduction and others with advances in EQT certification, indicating that as reported by ISP the aforementioned Decree No. 69/2024 reaches an approximate total of 250 records, of which only 20% will require demonstrating its EQT They have a condition of bioequivalent or correspond to reference products). <Br />
Finally, it is indicated that the studies carried out for the selection of products were executed at an intersectoral manner with broad participation of ISP/CENABAST representatives and MINSAL officials of different divisions of both sub -secretaries.  <Br />
<Br />
2nd due to current deadlines and expiring in September 2025 (D. Ex. Minsal No. 35/2024) for 71 p.a. Associated with a form of release: It is indicated that the usual monitoring will be carried out to verify advances in the certification, as was carried out before the expiration of previous deadlines, a process known by the regulated ones. <Br />
<Br />
3. Informs that modifications have been published to the EQT certification forms of the ISP, with limited implementation deadlines (3 months), including some new aspects and demands associated with “validation” of primary and secondary containers, an aspect that the novelty had not been included in the studies already ongoing and within such an limited implementation was not possible to incorporate. To date, they indicate that ISP has hosted its requirements and comments, and has extended in a year the implementation of the aforementioned requirement; But it is necessary to issue the respective technical guide, as long as there are no international reference guides or technical notes issued by the ISP, which allow to understand and implement the new requirements. <Br />
In this regard, they request greater coordination between the requirements of ISP and the Minsal regarding therapeutic equivalence and the different requirements that are added to the certification process. <Br />
It is reported that the respective consultations will be made..

Santiago, December 16, 2024. <Br />
<Br />
Lady <Br />
Ximena Aguilera Sanhueza <Br />
Minister of Health <Br />
Present <Br />
<Br />
Dear Minister <Br />
Together with greeting, we present the following situation that affects us severely, requesting support to be able to reverse it. <Br />
Our educational project began in 1999 by a group of specialist teachers of the “La Purísima School for Deaf Children” of the San Miguel commune, belonging to the Congregation of the Franciscan Sisters of the Immaculate. <Br />
After the closing of that establishment and a titanic effort, we managed to inaugurate the year 1999 the San Francisco de Asís College for deaf children, in the commune of Santiago. The initiative was supported by the San Andrés parish, from Santiago Centro, by providing us with the possibility of operating on its land with a low rental cost. <Br />
It is a differential teaching teaching establishment that attends auditory disability, with a course per level from pre Kinder to sixth basic, which serves children from 4 to 14 years and not more than 8 students per course. <Br />
The maintenance of the establishment is in charge of the San Francisco de Asís Educational Corporation, without profit. Our community is made up of families of medium and low medium socioeconomic and cultural level. Our team is made up of 15 people among professionals and administrative staff. <Br />
From its origins we have assumed our work with a high commitment to the deaf population, striving to move towards a proposal relevant to the challenges that we have in this area as a country. Coherently with international guidelines and, lately, with the National Health Policy (National Implant Program), our project differs from other special establishments of this type by enhancing all communicative abilities students: from speech to signs. <Br />
<Br />
<Br />
<Br />
In this line the project bets on a strong emphasis on expressive artistic work, particularly in the areas of plastic, music and body expression and, consistently, with that in socio -emotional skills. This is how within our achievements highlights the award of several external competitive funds: Culture Funds (2), Fonadis, Senadis, among others. Likewise, students and teachers carry out a meditation practice daily, an experience published in Europe in an indexed academic magazine. In the following links you can review these background in more detail: <Br />

https://digibug.ug.es/bitstream/handle/10481/42928/5-20.pdf?sequence=1&isallowed=y<br/>
However, for three years we have been unsuccessfully looking for a place where to continue our work since the pastor in charge of the parish requested the premises because it has been decided to develop a more profitable project.  And due to our delay in leaving it, he has demanded judicially. We have left the Episcopate, national goods, congressmen and other authorities without success. <Br />
In case of not having a place for next year, we will be forced to close, leaving our students and their families without this valuable alternative, to our workers without their work source and to the national environment without all the expertise accumulated in almost 26 years of a highly innovative, relevant and humanizing project. <Br />
Mrs. Minister of Health, by virtue of the above, is that we request their good reception, and allow us an interview to expose our case, with more details and manage a place in their prestigious commune that he directs to continue working. <Br />
Thanking your answer, you greet you carefully <Br />

Estimated, <Br />
<Br />
I would like to coordinate a meeting to present myself as CEO of SKED24, a Chilean company specialized in the digitalization of the schedule of medical hours in large clinics and hospitals. We have tools designed to optimize attention management, such as our waiting listas management module and care plans, solutions that could provide value to primary care. <Br />

Care plans allow structuring and automating the care of patients with specific needs through the allocation of scheduled benefits, such as medical consultations, exams or treatments. This not only improves the continuity of attention, but also facilitates traceability, optimizes a agend time and reduces the operational load of the system. <Br />

On March 21, 2025 at 10:30 AM, Juan COLLAO, the Head of the Department of Pharmaceutical Policies and Regulations, Health Providers and Complementary Medicines., attended a videoconferentia meeting via They will be contacted by Dipol

Celebration, modification or termination of any title, of contracts that carry out the passive subjects and that are necessary for their operation. 
Design, implementation and evaluation of policies, plans and programs carried out by the taxpayers..

**Purpose:**
Processes, waiting times, information from the medical professions area, the diverse information from one formalizer to another at the time of inspecting a medical area installation. <Br />
<Br />
Topics addressed in meeting <Br />
On March 21, 2025, in the city of Santiago, a meeting requested by Lobby's Law for Mrs. Claudia Jara, a private advisor of medical facilities, with the aim of raising observations and concerns around the processes of control and health resolution carried out by the health seremi. <Br />
Mr. Juan Collao and Mr. Bastián Abarzúa participate in this instance, who receive and collect the background presented by the applicant. <Br />
During the meeting, Mrs. Claudia Jara expresses a series of difficulties that she has identified in her professional work, mainly linked to the slowness and lack of continuity in health procedures. Although he acknowledges that the “Seremi online” platform has allowed to expedite documentary processes, warns that the main problems are concentrated in the field of control in the field, where excessive delays are presented, erroneous technical criteria and a lack of timely response that ends up affecting the normal development of the projects. <Br />
One of the cases exposed corresponds to the Seremi of the Metropolitan Region, where a official in charge of the health providers module (module 4) was absent by vacation and then by medical license, without assigning personnel in their replacement. As indicated, at the time of consulting, it was informed that most of the modules were oriented to the feeding area and that there was no attention available to the medical area. This situation would have generated the complete stoppage of a procedure, directly affecting the provider. Likewise, Mrs. Jara mentions that, since the transfer of the offices from Calle 18 to Bulnes Street, she has perceived a decrease in the quality of user service. <Br />
In another case, it is described how an inspector erroneously described as invasive a procedure that uses a non -invasive equipment, which forced the establishment to make modifications in its infrastructure that, according to the advisor, were not necessary. At the date of the meeting, more than 60 days have passed and the process has not yet been closed. A procedure that appears as closed in the system is also mentioned, but does not have a sanitary resolution, despite the fact that the infrastructure does not present observations. <Br />
On the other hand, the lack of access to clear and updated information in the official channels of the Seremi regarding the health authorization process is raised, which generates confusion and uncertainty both in the providers and in the advisory professionals. <Br />
In general, Mr. Juan Collao contextualizes that these problems respond, in part, to structural reasons. In particular, he mentions the sustained decrease in the budget of the Undersecretariat of Public Health during the last ten years, which has resulted in a low staffing. In the Metropolitan Region, there are currently only two inspectors in charge of the area of ​​medical providers, which is clearly insufficient to respond to the existing demand. To this is added that, product of administrative summaries, it has been disconnected to experienced officials, being replaced by new personnel who still do not have the necessary technical domain. <Br />
Likewise, it is recalled that, by legal provision, the Seremi officials cannot provide technical advice to the providers, since their function is strictly limited to control and evaluate in accordance with current regulations. <Br />
In the course of the meeting, Mrs. Claudia Jara informs Mr. Collao about a possible case of corruption related to her advice functions, noting that she has already entered a formal complaint both through the OIRS system and before the Investigation Police (PDI). It also indicates that the respective background for knowledge and monitoring will arrive. <Br />
Finally, a specific case is mentioned where an installation was authorized with cameras in procedure rooms, a situation that does not correspond according to current regulations. This fact was also observed as an irregular action by the inspection team. <Br />
There are no other issues to discuss, this act is raised for distribution and monitoring..

<Br />
• The reason for the lobby is to know the scope, deadlines and implementation of recent resolutions related to the list of high -cost drugs, which aims to prioritize and ensure the financing of specialized medicines for patients with cancer diseases. <Br />
• Reinaldo mentions that hospitals have no possibility to acquire via Cenabast with abemaciclib for not having coding, therefore, the possibility of code creation is not necessarily requested, not necessarily via Dac. <Br />
• Patricio Sarabia explains the way of operating Cebast (coding, demand capture). It is mentioned that this information is public and that this said, there are tenders that, depending on the mandate, only CENABAST is the acquisition route. <Br />
• Soledad mentions that 56 centralized DAC products recently received mandates, the mandate of a single product was needed. Progress has been made with the sanitary records of the products and that there are mostly more than one sanitary record, so it has to be tender and cannot enter the cause of mono supplier TD. In these cases, it is requested to be attentive to the public market portal, it is estimated to publish the first tenders in January 2025. Due to the change of public purchasing regulations, it should
• Reinaldo mentions that there are 3 products in DAC listing as the only drug, consultation by cycline inhibitor of the list of August 2024, therefore, the great demand was of that product, now there are 2 more alternatives, he would like to know how to identify the demand of each of them. Patricio Sarabia mentions that it depends on the mandate, if it indicates only one, it should be consulted for this product specifically. Patricio Sarabia mentions that he will review which cycline inhibitor is specific. <Br />
• Reinaldo mentions that, to understand intermediation, is it the only way to have codes? Beyond the financing route (DAC, INT, etc), but many hospitals say that if it is in Cenabast it is easier to buy it via Cenabast.  Javiera mentions the incorporation process to Cenabast's intermediation basket. <Br />
• Soledad Roa explains the bidding process, which covers approximately 9 months, as these products are more expensive, it would be published 30 days, it may be before or not, but it depends on the times of the CGR. <Br />
• Javiera complements that this would be under the same conditions, supply contract. <Br />

On January 07, 2025 at 10:00 AM, Susana Bobadilla, the Member of the evaluation commission formed within the framework of Law No. 19886, attended a videoconferentia meeting via Videoconference via Meet Tuesday, January 7, 2025 at 10 am (Meet.google.com/frq-odgo-sfk). The meeting lasted 1 horas, 0 minutos and focused on the Design, implementation and evaluation of policies, plans and programs carried out by the taxpayers..

**Purpose:**
Assistants: <Br />
Flexing: Gabriel Foucher, Valentín Díaz, Matías Lasagabaster <Br />
CENABAST: Sofía Olave and Susana Bobadilla <Br />
<Br />
Consultations made by Flexing: <Br />
1.- Doubts regarding exempt resolutions No. 7562 and 7563 and reasons for the revocation of tenders ID 621-646-LR24 and 621-707-LR24. <Br />
2.- Consultations on the validity of CE certificates under bases No. 87. <Br />
Background delivered: <Br />
Regarding point No. 1: The revocations of the tenders are related to chapter VI of the bidding base, specifically with the technical evaluation of offers regarding medical devices certifications. In this chapter, the presentation of certificates such as Directive 93/42/EEC (or its substitute regulations) and the FDA (CFG or CE marked) is established as a requirement. <Br/>
However, the regulatory transition in the European Community, led by regulations (EU) 2017/745 and 2017/746, has resulted in a regulation hybrid framework. This process has also been affected by the delays derived from the Covid-19 pandemic, making it difficult to identify valid certificates and their applicable periods. Given these difficulties, external entities have been used to obtain clarifications, which has generated significant delays in the technical evaluation of offers and has led to the revocation of current bidding processes. <Br />
In response to this situation, work is being done on a modification of the bases by the technical department related to this evaluation process. These modifications will be reviewed by the corresponding organizations and, subsequently, published and distributed among all those involved. <Br />
Regarding point No. 2, on the validity of CE certificates under bases No. 87: <Br />
A verbal summary was made by Cenabast of the four modifications of CE marking, highlighting that the last update, implemented in June 2024, has been the most complex to interpret due to the normative adjustments and particularities introduced in its implementation..

On January 09, 2025 at 09:30 AM, Patricio Sarabia, the Head of Operations Department - Supply, attended a in person meeting via In person, in San Eugenio 40, Ñuñoa, in 4th Meeting Room. floor.. The meeting lasted 1 horas, 0 minutos and focused on the Elaboration, dictation, modification, denial or rejection of administrative acts, bills and laws and also of the decisions made by passive subjects..

**Purpose:**
Lobby N° AO003AW 1739466<br />
<br />
Laboratorio:  ABBOTT<br />
Fecha y hora: jueves 09 enero 2025, 09:30 horas, <br />
Modalidad:  presencial<br />
Materia: Tratar lo sucedido acerca del proceso de compra que se ha llevado adelante con el Test de VIH de 4° generación<br />
<br />
Detalle de Reunión: <br />
<br />
1) TEST DE VIH:<br />
<br />
José Allemant, comenta que este proceso se ha caído 3 veces (por bases, participantes, mala conformación bajo la norma) y ahora hay un nuevo proceso. Minsal los ha contactado (Subsecretaría de Salud Pública) sobre cuándo estarían abasteciendo. Por lo que me gustaría saber a quién se le tiene que responder sobre esta compra.<br />
Patricio Sarabia comenta que una vez que hay mandato, el cual existe, la responsabilidad de los llamados a licitación y que todo esté en norma es trabajo de CENABAST. Actualmente hay un proceso de Cotización. <br />
<br />
Soledad Roa, comenta que hoy debería pasar a Dirección Técnica<br />
<br />
José Allemant, comenta que una vez quedaron fuera por un problema en la plataforma, pero su precio era 50%<br />
 más barato que el resto.<br />
<br />
Patricio Sarabia, lo importante es que el proceso actualmente está en curso, y el anterior ya quedó invalidado y ya cuenta con resolución.<br />
<br />
2) AEROVIAL Y SALMETEROL:<br />
<br />
José Allemant, solicita ayuda levantando este tema, ya que se debe hacer un análisis para el tamaño de partícula, el cual realiza el fabricante, cuando llegaba a chile lo que se hacía era solicitud de la exención de control de calidad, en otros países de alta vigilancia no se repetía este ensayo, si este ensayo no cumplía en el país de fabricación, se tenía que generar un retiro masivo, por lo que este ensayo es bien determinante. ISPCH informa que se harán las exenciones, pero desde octubre del 2024 ya no hay más exenciones, a lo cual Abbott accede solicitando un plazo y si este análisis no se hace en Chile, la autoridad sanitaria tendría que haber considerado esto con algún laboratorio de control de calidad. Abbott hizo ese trabajo y se negoció con varios laboratorios de control de calidad (8 que no lo hacían). Julio Jiménez menciona que este tamaño de partícula es el tamaño aerodinámico, equipo que no está en Chile y que este proceso toma mucho tiempo por la transferencia y validación del método analítico. Finalmente, se logró gestar con laboratorio CS LAB, pero debido a que se requiere equipamiento específico, por lo cual Abbot tendrá que pagar por este servicio.<br />
<br />
Javiera Rodríguez, consulta si es que hay contratos vigentes para estos productos, Carlota Quijada comenta que para el caso de Salmeterol que es más crítico se tiene un contrato vigente, pero con este tema de las no exenciones nos provocaron faltas y no se sabe el estado del contrato (no se despachó octubre-noviembre), a lo cual Javiera comenta que, debido a esto, se hizo término de contrato. Carlota comenta que el producto se contaba en Chile, pero debido a este cambio en la exigencia del ISPCH que no se pudo cumplir. Javiera comenta que el problema que hubo acá es que se cargó al sistema que el producto estaba disponible y eso sin tener las autorizaciones, lo cual intensificó la gravedad (esto se conversó directamente con Jorge Valenzuela de Abbott). Carlota, menciona que Salmeterol tiene una particularidad, ya que tiene pocos proveedores (Abbott y GSK), este producto actualmente está en las bodegas de Abbott y se han detectado algunas ventas por GSK a instituciones preocupadas por el producto a un costo muchísimo mayor, y gustaría saber cuál es el siguiente proceso ya que se cuenta con las unidades en plaza para poder suministrar a la red. <br />
Patricio Sarabia, comenta que ISPCH es quien da esa autorización, se tiene que revisar la forma de contrato, ya que por la modificación de la ley de compras es que la causal de trato directo fue eliminada, y el vector de compra que da este nuevo reglamento es una licitación pública, si esta no es exitosa, una licitación privada y en el tercer caso si esto fracasa, llegar a un trato directo.<br />
Javiera, comenta que para procesar una nueva adquisición tiene que estar concreto el término del contrato anterior, se evaluará con Jurídica CENABAST. La urgencia existe debido a la campaña de invierno. José Allemant comenta que de igual forma se debe solucionar este tema con el ISPCH, ya que esto tomaría 8 meses más en contar con el ensayo. Patricio Sarabia comenta que bajo situaciones de emergencia se puede solicitar un poco de flexibilidad. Javiera comenta que para hacer la gestión con el ISPCH es cuando haya un contrato de por medio.<br />
<br />
Respecto a Aerovial, tiene la misma situación, contrato vigente. Javiera consulta cómo han podido realizar las entregas, a lo cual Carlota comenta que el ISPCH le dio las exenciones y por eso se ha cumplido hasta la fecha, pero para las próximas entregas tendríamos este problema. Javiera comenta que en este caso se podría gestionar con el ISPCH para solicitar la exención. José Allamant comenta que Abbott realizará una solicitud de exención a ISPCH para Aerovial y se informará a CENABAST para apoyar con su gestión.<br />
<br />
Carlota comenta que para la campaña invierno en el otro hemisferio se espera que sea fuerte para Influenza muy disparada y Metapneumovirus humano. Los proveedores de Abbott le han comentado que la demanda estimada se considere un aumento<br />

Request for citation to mail katypinolopez@gmail.com was sent, Eduardo Moreno and Katherine Moreno were also included, please check whether the emails are correct or forward the citation.. The meeting lasted 1 horas, 0 minutos and focused on the Celebration, modification or termination of any title, of contracts that carry out the passive subjects and that are necessary for their operation..

**Purpose:**
Assistants: <Br />
Deterco (CEGAMED): Constanza Moreno- Eduardo Moreno <Br />
Ceabast: Sofia Olave - Katherine Acosta - Susana Bobadilla <Br />
<Br />
Theme addressed at the meeting: <Br />
The revocations of the tenders are related to chapter VI of the bidding base, specifically with the technical evaluation of offers regarding medical devices certifications. In this chapter, the presentation of certificates such as Directive 93/42/EEC (or its substitute regulations) and the FDA (CFG or CE marked) is established as a requirement. <Br/>
However, the normative transition in the European Community has resulted in a hybrid regulation framework. This process has also been affected by the delays derived from the Covid-19 pandemic, making it difficult to identify valid certificates and their applicable periods. Given these difficulties, external entities have been used to obtain clarifications, which has generated significant delays in the technical evaluation of offers and has led to the revocation of current bidding processes. <Br />
In response to this situation, work is being done on a modification of the bases by the technical department related to this evaluation process. These modifications will be reviewed by the corresponding organizations and, subsequently, published and distributed among all those involved. <Br />
The supplier was informed to enter another lobby audience to specifically review the ID621-664-LR24 tender process. This is due to the need to carry out a more detailed review of the associated documents. He also informed him that the tender will not be evaluated in conjunction with them, but doubts related to the certificates uploaded within the framework of this tender will be resolved..

During the analysis, a general review of the documents was carried out, and it was reported that the regulatory review of them was requested from the regulatory authority, despite the fact that two of them were not legalized or apostille. In addition, a discrepancy was identified in the classification established by the European Community. <Br />

**Purpose:**
Dear Mr. Espina <Br />
I turn to you due to the impossibility of being able to receive information that I have requested, and after much ask to be rectified, I do not make the data correct. <Br />
I have requested information from the Ricarte Soto law.  Until July 2024 I got the data and square the information.  This data corroborated it with the distribution information that Cenabast publishes. It follows that, if Cenabast publishes information, and I ask Cenabast the same information, but otherwise the data should square.  This does not happen. <Br />
I have requested this information by transparency law and does not block anywhere.  I have answered mail, I have put everything on my part to clarify the information and that I sent me what I ask, but upon incomplete every time (since August 2024). <Br />
Based on the above, request a meeting by Lobby to clarify why they do not add the data, since it is the same institution that manages them.  At the first meeting I was assigned to Mónica Robles, who exposed me that she did not handle that data, so she will request a meeting with another department.  I requested the meeting again and this time I was assigned to Mr. Hector Hernández.  Mr. Hernández indicates that he handles the distribution information, and that who is in charge of the department that prepares the information that this bad is Mrs. Javiera Hernández.  Request the meeting with Mrs. Hernández, who was canceled without reasons and that would make contact with me. <Br />
Indeed they called me and they remained again, without this happened until today. <Br />
Based on this I ask you to help me get a meeting with the person they deem appropriate, but who manages the distribution data of the Ricarte Soto law and the number of new and old patients (which until July 2024 were square).

There were another 6 and that were in the process of revocation about 30 more. They manifest no <Br />
understand why some were awarded. <Br />
The revocation resolution of the last 30 tender clearly explains the reason, along with <Br />
Advance that the relevant processes will be published again with a clarification. Tenders <Br />
involved were in "closed" state on the portal www.mercadopublico.cl and, in addition, <Br />
involves those that were kept internally in the technical stage (validation and <Br />
assessment). Other "closed" processes continued their course and eventually, they were awarded. <Br />
Depending on the need for supply, it is possible that some contracts have been <Br />
renewed, in which case the publications will occur in later periods. <Br />
Regulatory changes in the European Community, which include successive amendments, lack of <Br />
traceability of some documents and the non -existence of a mechanism to clarify controversies <Br />
Among suppliers it triggered this measure together with the presentation to the CGR of the modification of the <Br />
Bases for reasoning. <Br />

The supplier is explained that the bidding process is carried out exclusively through the Public Market Portal. It is essential that they are attentive to this portal to know the available opportunities. <Br />

About second -line products for lung cancer, these are 13% cheaper. In case CENABAST does not provide them, establishments must make direct purchase to special purchases. <Br />
The therapeutic technical definition is carried out by the Ministry, who tended by scheme. <Br />
In relation to the shared risk agreement, there is a medical need in Chile for patients, especially in regions such as Antofagasta, where the mortality index for this disease is high. It seeks to include the product in GES and that there is refund. It is important to remember that the technical definition is granted by Minsal, did not have dinner. <Br />

**Purpose:**
BSN Medical - Folio AO003AW 1757824 <Br />
Date: January 30, 2025 09:30 am <Br />
Subject: Current and future intermediation of the Sorbact Tórula product awarded in the CENABAST 100004026. <Br />
<Br />
The objective of this meeting is to inform about the discontinuation of the Sorbact Product Tórula 3 cm (64 cm2) worldwide, which is currently being delivered within the framework of the purchase order 4500035437 (ID 621-388-LR24). This acquisition has deliveries until June 2025, which will not be affected. However, this product will be discontinued as announced in a hearing of the year 2023 and that is why they did not participate in the latest tender 621-941-LR24, which was finally declared deserted without offers. It is requested that the discontinuation of the Soorula Product Tórula be formally communicated by letter to the director of Cenabast. <Br />
<Br />
To meet the needs of health establishments, we are informed about the transition to the Sorbact product 4x6cm (168 cm2), which would be an adequate solution for health professionals and patients. This process has a transition accompaniment plan contemplated, with training to the end users nationwide to solve doubts. The transition does not imply a cost increase. A sheet is equivalent to 2.6 torulas, but can be cut to adjust to the size of the wound. <Br />
<Br />
From Cenabast, they are consulted if they have units available to extend the current contract a little more, which they will review and inform directly to acquisitions. <Br />
<Br />
Finally, with respect to the new product in slices, it does not have code in Cenabast and for this reason, to evaluate its incorporation into the basket, it is requested that they reach the participants of this meeting the technical specifications of the product and the transactions in public market (if it exists to date, understanding that it is a new product). <Br />

**Purpose:**
AO003AW1768507 <Br />
Date Tuesday, March 6, 2025 - 09:30 h <Br />
 <Br />
Subject: Traceability of pharmaceutical products. <Br />
<Br />
Claudio González makes a small introduction of his company, based on his experience in <Br />
Income of Pharmaceutical Products Record requests to the ISP, taking a look from the <Br />
public health and opportunities that could be taken into consideration, such as ensuring a <Br />
Quality standard without having major price repercussions. <Br />
Consider keeping in mind the following topics: <Br />
1. Scope of the demand for therapeutic equivalence (EQT). <Br />
2. Scope of the quality of imported products <Br />
3. Legal documentation that allows us to ensure quality, if handled correctly. <Br />
Relationship between the inspection and the buyer. <Br />
With respect to the first point, it refers to the current process that shows the photograph of the moment. <Br />
With different lots, reproducibility in other lots is ensured and over time. The industry <Br />
It has GMP, CPP, API or Pt. <Br />
With respect to the possibility of incorporating improvements in the bases, as a point to improve the <Br />
Quality of imported products, comments that GMP is not distinguished depending on the type <Br />
of agency where the product is being marketed, because the more strengthened is <Br />
Supervision (high surveillance), the risk of sacrificing quality is less; especially if you buy <Br />
with the level of control in Chile. <Br />
Faced with possible quality problems, immediate availability of the BMR could be requested, <Br />
to facilitate research by ISP. <Br />
Finally, he comments that there are currently measures implemented by the supervisory entity in <Br />
Chile, which are generating an impact on the buyer; For example, Cenabast. This generates <Br />
a lot of pressure to release and make it think if there was a correct evaluation of the impact of <Br />
measure, which can finally affect the continuity of treatments. <Br />

Celebration, modification or termination of any title, of contracts that carry out passive subjects and that are necessary for their operation..

**Purpose:**
Lobby N° AO003AW 1791508 -1797607<br />
Laboratorio:  SANDOZ <br />
Fecha y hora: 04-02-2025, 12:00 horas, <br />
Modalidad:  Meet<br />
Materia: Contrato Omnitrope 10 mg ID 621-425-SC24<br />
<br />
Detalle de Reunión: <br />
<br />
Lobby solicitado por contrato con Omnitrope 10 mg e informar respecto al lanzamiento del Denosumab 60 mg.<br />
<br />
1.        OMNITROPE 10 MG<br />
Edgar, consulta respecto al inicio del contrato para OMNITROPE 10 MG, debido a que recibe muchas consultas al mes sobre la disponibilidad. Hasta ahora solo han podido entregar a un solo cliente por solicitud de CENABAST, esto considerando ya que se encuentra con la OC, el producto no recibe solicitud de distribución, esto considerando que estaba pactado inicio desde enero de 2025.<br />
Gisela Informa que la resolución que aprueba es del 29 de noviembre del 2024. Debido a que teníamos otro contrato en proceso, teníamos que hacer uso de ese contrato para dar inicio a este nuevo contrato con Sandoz. Además, no teníamos las ofertas para la demanda debido a que las entregas se estaban cumpliendo con el contrato vigente.<br />
Edgar consulta si el contrato con el proveedor se renovará. Menciona que los médicos no han aceptado el cambio de la marca, pero los hospitales prefieren la adquisición a través de Cenabast.<br />
Cristóbal comenta que las farmacias les consultan directamente a ellos, por ejemplo, Lo Barnechea les ha consultado por la solicitud de este producto.<br />
Gisela comenta que debido a problemas de abastecimiento se tuvo que buscar proveedores, y ya que es un producto biológico hubo retraso en el inicio del contrato. Por lo que se tuvo que retrasar el inicio del contrato con Sandoz, por esto también es que se demostró el inicio de este contrato inicialmente con la línea de farmacias privadas. Pamela complementa que, respecto a Farmacias Privadas, Cenabast informa la quincena de marzo la demanda de abril y debido a ajustes internos es que ya se gestionó la demanda de abril para Omnitrope para 3000 CAJ.<br />
Edgar comenta que el producto llega a chile con 18 meses de vigencia junto a los análisis es que ya se van 3 meses, y como se requiere 1 mes antes de la certificación, es por esto por lo que el período máximo es de 14 meses.<br />
Patricio consulta si es que Sandoz es el que informó a las farmacias sobre la disponibilidad de Omnitrope.<br />
Cristóbal comenta que la demanda de este producto la ve los endocrinólogos infantiles, y se entiende que la alternativa no ha sido validada por ellos, el producto de Sandoz tiene que salir debido a que hay muchos niños que requieren el tratamiento, pero debido a que no han tenido claridad de las preguntas que se han hecho es que se informa al mercado. Donde ha sido más compleja esta provisión han sido las farmacias municipales (por ejemplo, lo Barnechea). Sucede que esto partía en enero y Sandoz estaba expectante, y como se realiza visitas médicas es que Sandoz tenía estas fechas consideradas, y se le informó a cada médico que estas solicitudes deben gestionarse a través de CENABAST.<br />
Gisela comenta que se van a descertificar las unidades de entrega de enero, febrero y marzo y ajustar los pedidos de compra.<br />
2.        DENOSUBAB<br />
Edgar comenta que Jubbonti y Wyost tienen autorización de la EMA y de la FDA. Se vio que la primera licitación fue declarada desierta. <br />
Edgar, menciona que, entre más proveedores mejores para el abastecimiento, y que para principios del 2026 ya van a haber 4 proveedores en el mercado, se ha visto que año a año ha ido aumentando el precio, pero al haber más participantes estos deberían disminuir. Ante la licitación cerrada hoy con inicio septiembre 2025 y termina febrero 2027, por lo que en enero 2026 donde podría haber hecho una propuesta para que participaran 4 competidores es que este gasto disminuiría. Entonces, se hace énfasis en que es prudente hacer revisión de los plazos de distribución, y que los 18 meses es el máximo de un contrato respecto al uso de los recursos, y podría darse cuenta de que la licitación sea más corta y permita la competencia entre proveedores.<br />
Edgar, menciona que los otros registros en curso corresponden a Sandoz, Exeltis y Abbot.<br />
Patricio, comenta que no podemos referirnos a un proceso en evaluación, peor que estas bases pasan por fiscalía y pasan por toma de razón de la contraloría general de la república, por lo cual es difícil de modificar. Cenabast busca la sana competencia y es por esto las bases de licitación, ya veces tenemos estos desfases de registros.<br />
Soledad, menciona que esta licitación está en curso y se encuentra en evaluación, y se menciona que se respondió una carta de Sandoz consultando respecto a Denosumab.<br />
Cristóbal, menciona que el registro estaría aproximadamente a inicios del próximo año.<br />

LOBBY N ° AO003AW 1793909 <Br />
Laboratory: BPH Spa <Br />
Date and time: 02-04-2025, 3:00 p.m.
Modality: Meet <Br />
Subject: Address the consumption of contract 621-481-LR24 which considers 725,620 units. But according to projections per winter campaign and future consumption, only approximately 280,600 units will be consumed, which is equivalent to 40% of the total contract <Br />
<Br />
CONTRACT OR EXTENSION JUSTICE to achieve greater consumption of the units awarded. <Br />
<Br />
Meeting Detail: <Br />
<Br />
Patricio Valenzuela, the contract in execution (621-481-LR24) will not reach consumption beyond 40% and under this worry a lot, it affected a lot of deep analysis is that there is no market for this product and will have greater consumption. Already with the consumption already requested they are quite low and the projections do not exceed 40% of the contract and that is why this lobby. Purchases have already been confirmed and the product is already coming, there was no way to stop production. <Br />
Gisela, don't they have space to stop this 30% so that it does not arrive? <Br />
Patricio Valenzuela, responds that 30% that 30% is not that it depends on the supplier but also in transit. <Br />
Gisela, consults for expiration, since this contract is just initiating and this contract is until 2026. <Br />
Patricio, says that the expiration is at the end of the year of 2026 <Br />
<Br />
Gisela, reports that there was an error in the programming of some establishments, and at the time of reprogramming the establishment realizes that demand, and that is why the contract is under supply. <Br />
Gisela, proposes to review the demand for demand throughout the year. <Br />
Patricio Valenzuela, requests that this be another type of contract, for this product it is the first contract, and are initiating with this drug and the demands were clear, it is understood that it is a contract under supply, but what causes impact is that it is a variation of 60%. In addition, this product should generate only in winter and it would be in the months of now (April to June), to think that in summer they will request much more product is that it does not come to the case. If this contract is not possible to reach 80%, it will be a loss. <Br />
Patricio Sarabia, mentions that, if renewed, the bases of the current contract are maintained. You cannot answer now that this is what is going to be done, but the legal team must be consulted. <Br />
Gisela comments that it is awarded for a monthly demand of 8000 CAJ. Additionally, Gisela, mentions that establishments the minimum they receive is 7 months of validity. <Br />
Patricio Sarabia will consult the legal department. <Br />
Patricio Valenzuela, comments that they have been raising a possible market in the private, but it is expected that it is initially a solution by Cenabast, so it is requested please see this particular issue. <Br />
Additionally, Patricio Valenzuela, consults regarding the contract for valproic acid, which was divided into two channels, INT and pharmacy chains, 55 - 45%was distributed, but chain consumption to this contract has been at zero. This would lead to the consumption of 50% of the contract. <Br />
Patricio Sarabia, mentions that this will be reviewed seeing a proposal for this material once the coverage and demand review has been made, it would be informing next week. <Br />

On April 30, 2025 at 04:00 PM, Patricio Sarabia, the Head of Operations Department - Supply, attended a videoconferentia meeting via Google Meet.. The meeting lasted 1 horas, 0 minutos and focused on the Elaboration, dictation, modification, denial or rejection of administrative acts, bills and laws and also of the decisions made by passive subjects..

**Purpose:**
Lobby N° AO003AW 1817077<br />
Laboratorio:   UC CHRISTUS<br />
Fecha y hora: 30-04-2025, 16:00 horas, <br />
Modalidad:  Meet<br />
Materia: Contrato Omnitrope 10 mg ID 621-425-SC24<br />
<br />
Detalle de Reunión: <br />
Se inició la reunión:<br />
Kreuza, menciona que necesita orientación respecto a los quiebres de stock de algunos insumos y medicamentos. Inicialmente se había solicitado Lobby al Area Legal de Cenabast, pero fue rechazado, por lo que se consideró que lo más apropiado era el Area de Abastecimiento.<br />
<br />
Fabián, consulta si tienen un rut distinto al Hospital Clínico de la UC como UC CHRISTUS.<br />
Kreuza dice que la UC es dueña de la red de salud y el 2016 buscó un socio con una sociedad sin fines de lucro norteamericana, y ahí nace UC CHRISTUS SPA. Estas son las sociedades que operan en las Clínicas y San Carlos, este rut está constituido por la PUC y el socio norteamericano, el Rut es el 99.573.490-7.<br />
Fabián, menciona que según el rut es que Cenabast no le entrega medicamentos con excepción del Nimodipino.<br />
Carolina, responde que se tuvo bajo el rut de la PUC un convenio asociado a VIH por el mandato del Minsal y Fonasa y por otro de ancora (DFL36) a través del SS Oriente. El DFL aún se mantiene en el rut 81 y respecto al convenio de VIH, Fonasa definió que, cuando se hizo el cambio de rut, Fonasa definió no pasar por intermedio de Cenabast y directamente con MINSAL. El convenio de VIH lo tienen como UC Christus y no como intermediación CENABAST.<br />
<br />
Fabián, menciona que CENABAST puede intermediar con UC Christus pero necesitan que el DLF36 se mencione que este convenio aplica a UC Christus y no solo al hospital de la PUC, en el DFL que se mencione el pagador.<br />
Kreuza, dice que no van a tener DFL36, ya que es exclusivo para los Ancora y Cesfam y ahí se mantiene el rut, va a pasar prontamente de la fundación ancora UC, esa asociación va a ser exclusiva con el DFL36. por esto, es que le gustaría saber si es posible contar con un convenio Sin DFL 36.<br />
Fabian, menciona que Cenabast cuenta con tres grandes líneas de negocio, la primera son los PM (Ministerio mandata a despachar medicamentos, por ejemplo LRS, judicializados), la segunda es la intermediación, donde cualquier establecimiento pagador accede a una canasta de medicamentos y en ese caso solamente  lo que nos ampara la legislación de Cenabast es abastecer la red de salud pública y los establecimientos que cuentan con autorización especial (convenio con algún servicio, por ejemplo), esto se ampara en el DFL 36, por lo que un privado NO puede intermediar con Cenabast sin DFL36, a excepción de, tercero, casos de desabastecimiento indicados por la autoridad sanitaria, por ejemplo, epinefrina o productos de campaña invierno, ya que hay un oficio que solicita monitorear el abastecimiento de estos productos, y en este caso es que son los privados que pueden acercarse  a Cenabast a intermediar o solicitar a Cenabast gestionar con los proveedores la venta directa. Finalmente, Ley Cenabast, venta a farmacias y a fundaciones sin fines de lucro, se desconoce si UC Christus cae en esta categoría (se pregunta), si no, la única por ley sería a través de una farmacia de venta directa.<br />
 <br />
1. Programas Ministeriales Mandatados<br />
2. Establecimiento compra directo a CENABAST necesita un DFL 36 (Intermediación)<br />
3. Ley CENABAST<br />
4. Quiebres de stock por desabastecimiento decretado.<br />
<br />
Patricio, comenta que Ketamina es posible autorizar el despacho porque hay decreto de desabastecimiento de este producto. Este desabastecimiento fue decretado por el Ministerio.<br />
Fabian, pregunta con quién se comunicaron con ketamina,<br />
Sandra, dice que le responde Carolina Miranda y se informaron por correo electrónico con esa información<br />
<br />
Sandra, consulta por Epinefrina, Patricio dice que estaban supliendo a los hospitales y el proveedor está liberando los embarques y está gestionando la venta directa, el proveedor es blau farmacéutica, tiene algo de stock, algunos están en análisis, algunos liberados para suplir a la red pública están llegando lotes, no se vislumbra que se restablezca la producción de esto a corto plazo.<br />
 Fabian, dice que es necesario que se contacten con Blau Farmacéutica, por ketamina es posible gestionar directamente en CENABAST.<br />
Sandra, consulta por oncológicos, por cierta cantidad de productos, ahí se solicitó y solo recibieron algunos productos.<br />
Fabián, dice que esto fue instruido por salud pública y la superintendencia de salud para los 1999 pacientes, si se solicita el abastecimiento de uno de estos pacientes le vamos a enviar el ordinario si no lo tienen, deben solicitar por nombre y apellido el paciente , a quien va dirigido y cenabast tiene 2 vias: 1) cenabast contacta al laboratorio y le informamos que UC Christus solicita, si tienen stock y le damos el contacto de UC Christus y 2) el proveedor que pese a esa gestión  decida no venderles, ahí se intercede y por el contrato de cenabast y autorización de la superintendencia de salud se despacha con precio CENABAST.<br />
Mariela, consulta sobre la particularidad de oncológicos que tienen sus dosis por ciclos, para solicitar hay alguna temporalidad de tratamiento ,se debe solicitar por dosis,? Fabián responde que no, solo identificar al paciente<br />
La segunda duda de Mariela de los 1999 pacientes, ¿todos los días se ingresan pacientes, que pasa con los pacientes nuevos? Fabián dice que, si es un paciente nuevo, dado que ustedes nos dicen que es nuevo, se informa a la superintendencia de salud y procedemos con el abastecimiento.<br />
<br />
Kreuza, pide por favor considerar las diferencias de rut, Fabián, pide si puede enviar el correo con el nombre y rut del Hospital Clínico de la católica, ancora, UC Christus, etc.<br />
Kreuza, le gustaría a través de vender a farmacias privadas, porque UC Christus podría tener una asociación con una farmacia privada y esta farmacia se podría inscribir. Fabián, dice que sí, pero sería una relación CENABAST-farmacia y luego ustedes deben ver la coordinación con la farmacia al hospital, por ejemplo, una farmacia no puede venderle a una clínica, pero sí a un paciente, ya que, si no, eso sería de una droguería.  Fabián, menciona que esta línea de farmacias privadas es un pool de medicamentos del arsenal que trabaja CENABAST.<br />

Subject: Update product situation 3cm acetate torula that will now be marketed in sheets. <Br />
<Br />
Within the framework of the renewal of the current contract in Tórulas, it is reported that it was already accepted and would cover the demand until August. The idea is to prevent the lack of supplies for the coming months, which would be in sheets. <Br />
<Br />
Topics related to the transition from Sorbact Tórulas to Sorbact Plate 4x6 were addressed, it was emphasized that the 4x6 sheet offers logistics advantages, equivalent to 2.6 torulas, and the willingness to carry out training for end users and formal communication to customers. Recommendations were presented on the proper use of torulas and dressings, warning about the loss of sterility and the effectiveness of the products. <Br />
<Br />
Due to the discontinuation of the torula, they mention that they need 4 months in advance to be able to manufacture, import and deliver the product in a timely manner, in the new contract. <Br />
<Br />
A new transition schedule was discussed until August 2025 and the approval of the new product, as well as the need for coordination with the CENABAST operations departments (acquisitions, users and contracts), to ensure continuous supply. In addition, it was reported that there is no direct competition in the Chilean market and the importance of paying close attention was highlighted when making the offer, especially the product admissibility documentation in the acquisition processes. <Br />

The meeting lasted 1 horas, 0 minutos and focused on the Design, implementation and evaluation of policies, plans and programs carried out by the taxpayers..

**Purpose:**
Since I am working on an investigation into public acquisitions in the health sector, together with Julio Peña, principal researcher at Clapes UC, at the Audience to Fonasa I would like to consult respective information to two particular issues: <Br />
<Br />
1. Direct purchase due to gaps in MAI care: What was the start date of the formalization of these expenses?; Why in 2022 was such a high percentage of purchases via direct treatment to acquire critical beds?; What are the specific reasons that prevent the public system from complying with the demand for critical beds already tendered?; When talking about the clinics that are "in agreement" with Fonasa, do you refer to clinics that win the tender of critical beds?; Among other consultations. <Br />
2. GES: How much is the fiscal expense of this guarantees program? Previously they have sent us information on how much fonasa spends for "delays and claims GES", but we would like to know how much the state expense is for the normal execution program (spending by GES consultations, medications, exams, supplies, etc.). Regarding the latter, we know that there are cost verification reports (EVC), but we would like to obtain the expense data executed, rather than an expected cost..

**Purpose:**
Dear Gonzalo, <Br />
 <Br />
I am Oscar Franco, representative of Amazon Web Services (AWS) for the public sector in Latin America, I take part in its account team which leads Fabian Luengo. <Br />
I address you with the purpose of coordinating a virtual meeting where we can explore your strategic objectives and technological projects planned by 2025. In this meeting, we would like
<Br />
AWS offers specially designed services for public health institutions such as Fonasa. I would like to highlight three of them: <Br />
<Br />
Amazon Healthlake: Allows you to store and analyze large volumes of health data safely and comply with sector regulations. For example, it could be used to centralize and analyze medical care data nationwide. <Br />
<Br />
Amazon Connect: Contact Center platform in the cloud that could significantly improve attention to beneficiaries, allowing a more efficient management of consultations and claims. <Br />
<Br />
AWS LAMBDA: No server computing service that can automate key processes, such as benefit validation or approval of real -time medical benefits. <Br />
<Br />
As a relevant use case, the United Kingdom National Health Service implemented a AWS cloud-based platform to manage the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, managing to effectively coordinate the vaccination of millions of citizens. <Br />
<Br />
Do you think it is convenient to schedule a virtual meeting the next weeks? I am available to adapt to your agenda. <Br />
If in fact, this is not a matter of interest, I would be very grateful if he is heading with the right person. <Br />
