On January 14, 2025 at 03:00 AM, María Espinoza, the Chief Department Ges Complex networks and programmatic lines., attended a in person meeting via Monjitas 565, 9th floor
From Fresenius Care, the following history of the meeting are presented.
- General pocket spending data is reported that must be assumed by users and their families, associated with the cost in transportation for retreat. The meeting lasted 1 horas, 0 minutos and focused on the Design, implementation and evaluation of policies, plans and programs carried out by the taxpayers..

**Purpose:**
Meeting request to present pilot plan for the benefit of patients with home enteral nutrition. <Br />
Estimated Andrea: <Br />
My name is Barbara Cabrera, head of access to markets in Fresenius Kabi, one of the main suppliers of enteral nutrition for beneficiaries of Ricarte Soto law. I allow myself to address you to request a meeting with the objective of presenting a pilot plan that we have developed to benefit 100 patients from 6 health institutions who require enteral nutrition. <Br />
Currently, these patients should remove more than 30 kilos of product monthly and transport them by their own means to their homes, which generates a considerable load and a pocket expense for the family. Our pilot plan proposes to incorporate a direct transfer service to the patient's home, complemented with personalized clinical monitoring to guarantee the continuity and effectiveness of the treatment and thus support the network institutions in their daily work. <Br />
In addition, one of the main strengths of this program is that it does not represent an additional cost, and its expectation is that it can be lavished progressively nationwide, expanding the benefit to a greater number of patients in similar conditions. <Br />
We are convinced that this project can transform the experience of patients, simplify their access to treatments and improve their quality of life, so we consider the participation and support of the Ministry of Health for its implementation and initial evaluation. <Br />
We are attentive to its availability to coordinate this meeting, either in person or virtual, as they consider more convenient. <Br />
Thanking in advance your attention and interest, I remain at your disposal to expand any detail or provide additional information. <Br />
Sincerely, <Br />
Bárbara Cabrera Leyton.

**Purpose:**
New listings of active ingredients that must demonstrate bioequivalence. Implications for the local pharmaceutical industry <Br />
<Br />
Topics addressed in meeting: <Br />
Consultations are made on the following subjects associated with EQT/Therapeutic equivalence certification.  <Br />
<Br />
1. Molecules selection criteria to which they have been given in the last decree (D. Ex. MINSAL N ° 69/2024): It is indicated that the product selection study was carried out from those who already had a reference designation (231 p.a associated with a pharmaceutical and release form, established in the D. Ex. MINSAL N ° 51/2023 and N ° 8/ Employees were multiple, especially considering the degrees of progress in certification for each P.A. and formulation that is intended to submit to the demand; the market, consumption and access situation; The incorporation of these into some public health strategy such as GES or similar; and the essentiality of the product. However, it is indicated that special care was taken that the demand did not affect relevant markets and the availability of products.  Likewise, it is noted that the requirement of EQT for solid pharmaceutical forms is long and approximately advanced over 2/3 of the total products; and the current requirement, incorporated by D. Ex. MINSAL N ° 69/2024 is focused on advancing in the last third, where there are mostly products of recent introduction and others with advances in EQT certification, indicating that as reported by ISP the aforementioned Decree No. 69/2024 reaches an approximate total of 250 records, of which only 20% will require demonstrating its EQT They have a condition of bioequivalent or correspond to reference products). <Br />
Finally, it is indicated that the studies carried out for the selection of products were executed at an intersectoral manner with broad participation of ISP/CENABAST representatives and MINSAL officials of different divisions of both sub -secretaries.  <Br />
<Br />
2nd due to current deadlines and expiring in September 2025 (D. Ex. Minsal No. 35/2024) for 71 p.a. Associated with a form of release: It is indicated that the usual monitoring will be carried out to verify advances in the certification, as was carried out before the expiration of previous deadlines, a process known by the regulated ones. <Br />
<Br />
3. Informs that modifications have been published to the EQT certification forms of the ISP, with limited implementation deadlines (3 months), including some new aspects and demands associated with “validation” of primary and secondary containers, an aspect that the novelty had not been included in the studies already ongoing and within such an limited implementation was not possible to incorporate. To date, they indicate that ISP has hosted its requirements and comments, and has extended in a year the implementation of the aforementioned requirement; But it is necessary to issue the respective technical guide, as long as there are no international reference guides or technical notes issued by the ISP, which allow to understand and implement the new requirements. <Br />
In this regard, they request greater coordination between the requirements of ISP and the Minsal regarding therapeutic equivalence and the different requirements that are added to the certification process. <Br />
It is reported that the respective consultations will be made..

Santiago, December 16, 2024. <Br />
<Br />
Lady <Br />
Ximena Aguilera Sanhueza <Br />
Minister of Health <Br />
Present <Br />
<Br />
Dear Minister <Br />
Together with greeting, we present the following situation that affects us severely, requesting support to be able to reverse it. <Br />
Our educational project began in 1999 by a group of specialist teachers of the “La Purísima School for Deaf Children” of the San Miguel commune, belonging to the Congregation of the Franciscan Sisters of the Immaculate. <Br />
After the closing of that establishment and a titanic effort, we managed to inaugurate the year 1999 the San Francisco de Asís College for deaf children, in the commune of Santiago. The initiative was supported by the San Andrés parish, from Santiago Centro, by providing us with the possibility of operating on its land with a low rental cost. <Br />
It is a differential teaching teaching establishment that attends auditory disability, with a course per level from pre Kinder to sixth basic, which serves children from 4 to 14 years and not more than 8 students per course. <Br />
The maintenance of the establishment is in charge of the San Francisco de Asís Educational Corporation, without profit. Our community is made up of families of medium and low medium socioeconomic and cultural level. Our team is made up of 15 people among professionals and administrative staff. <Br />
From its origins we have assumed our work with a high commitment to the deaf population, striving to move towards a proposal relevant to the challenges that we have in this area as a country. Coherently with international guidelines and, lately, with the National Health Policy (National Implant Program), our project differs from other special establishments of this type by enhancing all communicative abilities students: from speech to signs. <Br />
<Br />
<Br />
<Br />
In this line the project bets on a strong emphasis on expressive artistic work, particularly in the areas of plastic, music and body expression and, consistently, with that in socio -emotional skills. This is how within our achievements highlights the award of several external competitive funds: Culture Funds (2), Fonadis, Senadis, among others. Likewise, students and teachers carry out a meditation practice daily, an experience published in Europe in an indexed academic magazine. In the following links you can review these background in more detail: <Br />

https://digibug.ug.es/bitstream/handle/10481/42928/5-20.pdf?sequence=1&isallowed=y<br/>
However, for three years we have been unsuccessfully looking for a place where to continue our work since the pastor in charge of the parish requested the premises because it has been decided to develop a more profitable project.  And due to our delay in leaving it, he has demanded judicially. We have left the Episcopate, national goods, congressmen and other authorities without success. <Br />
In case of not having a place for next year, we will be forced to close, leaving our students and their families without this valuable alternative, to our workers without their work source and to the national environment without all the expertise accumulated in almost 26 years of a highly innovative, relevant and humanizing project. <Br />
Mrs. Minister of Health, by virtue of the above, is that we request their good reception, and allow us an interview to expose our case, with more details and manage a place in their prestigious commune that he directs to continue working. <Br />
Thanking your answer, you greet you carefully <Br />

Estimated, <Br />
<Br />
I would like to coordinate a meeting to present myself as CEO of SKED24, a Chilean company specialized in the digitalization of the schedule of medical hours in large clinics and hospitals. We have tools designed to optimize attention management, such as our waiting listas management module and care plans, solutions that could provide value to primary care. <Br />

Care plans allow structuring and automating the care of patients with specific needs through the allocation of scheduled benefits, such as medical consultations, exams or treatments. This not only improves the continuity of attention, but also facilitates traceability, optimizes a agend time and reduces the operational load of the system. <Br />

On March 21, 2025 at 10:30 AM, Juan COLLAO, the Head of the Department of Pharmaceutical Policies and Regulations, Health Providers and Complementary Medicines., attended a videoconferentia meeting via They will be contacted by Dipol

Celebration, modification or termination of any title, of contracts that carry out the passive subjects and that are necessary for their operation. 
Design, implementation and evaluation of policies, plans and programs carried out by the taxpayers..

**Purpose:**
Processes, waiting times, information from the medical professions area, the diverse information from one formalizer to another at the time of inspecting a medical area installation. <Br />
<Br />
Topics addressed in meeting <Br />
On March 21, 2025, in the city of Santiago, a meeting requested by Lobby's Law for Mrs. Claudia Jara, a private advisor of medical facilities, with the aim of raising observations and concerns around the processes of control and health resolution carried out by the health seremi. <Br />
Mr. Juan Collao and Mr. Bastián Abarzúa participate in this instance, who receive and collect the background presented by the applicant. <Br />
During the meeting, Mrs. Claudia Jara expresses a series of difficulties that she has identified in her professional work, mainly linked to the slowness and lack of continuity in health procedures. Although he acknowledges that the “Seremi online” platform has allowed to expedite documentary processes, warns that the main problems are concentrated in the field of control in the field, where excessive delays are presented, erroneous technical criteria and a lack of timely response that ends up affecting the normal development of the projects. <Br />
One of the cases exposed corresponds to the Seremi of the Metropolitan Region, where a official in charge of the health providers module (module 4) was absent by vacation and then by medical license, without assigning personnel in their replacement. As indicated, at the time of consulting, it was informed that most of the modules were oriented to the feeding area and that there was no attention available to the medical area. This situation would have generated the complete stoppage of a procedure, directly affecting the provider. Likewise, Mrs. Jara mentions that, since the transfer of the offices from Calle 18 to Bulnes Street, she has perceived a decrease in the quality of user service. <Br />
In another case, it is described how an inspector erroneously described as invasive a procedure that uses a non -invasive equipment, which forced the establishment to make modifications in its infrastructure that, according to the advisor, were not necessary. At the date of the meeting, more than 60 days have passed and the process has not yet been closed. A procedure that appears as closed in the system is also mentioned, but does not have a sanitary resolution, despite the fact that the infrastructure does not present observations. <Br />
On the other hand, the lack of access to clear and updated information in the official channels of the Seremi regarding the health authorization process is raised, which generates confusion and uncertainty both in the providers and in the advisory professionals. <Br />
In general, Mr. Juan Collao contextualizes that these problems respond, in part, to structural reasons. In particular, he mentions the sustained decrease in the budget of the Undersecretariat of Public Health during the last ten years, which has resulted in a low staffing. In the Metropolitan Region, there are currently only two inspectors in charge of the area of ​​medical providers, which is clearly insufficient to respond to the existing demand. To this is added that, product of administrative summaries, it has been disconnected to experienced officials, being replaced by new personnel who still do not have the necessary technical domain. <Br />
Likewise, it is recalled that, by legal provision, the Seremi officials cannot provide technical advice to the providers, since their function is strictly limited to control and evaluate in accordance with current regulations. <Br />
In the course of the meeting, Mrs. Claudia Jara informs Mr. Collao about a possible case of corruption related to her advice functions, noting that she has already entered a formal complaint both through the OIRS system and before the Investigation Police (PDI). It also indicates that the respective background for knowledge and monitoring will arrive. <Br />
Finally, a specific case is mentioned where an installation was authorized with cameras in procedure rooms, a situation that does not correspond according to current regulations. This fact was also observed as an irregular action by the inspection team. <Br />
There are no other issues to discuss, this act is raised for distribution and monitoring..
