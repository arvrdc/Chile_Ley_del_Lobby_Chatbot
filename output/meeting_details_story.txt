📄 **Meeting Highlights and Notes**  
During the meeting, the following topics and points were discussed:  
- The lack of resources and access to innovative therapies is one of the major limitations at the public level for the treatment of cancer. The incorporation of LENVATINIB in the GES basket represented a quantum leap for the treatment of REFRACTORY THYROID CANCER since patients only had access to a drug through DAC that was much inferior in potency and safety. In addition, the laboratory presented an economic proposal where the innovative drug (lenvatinib) was cheaper than sorafenib. There is a second indication (HEPATOCARCINOMA) where the proposal was presented, but ETESA only considered Global Survival and the total number of Adverse Effects as parameters. The REFLECT study (Head to Head lenvatinib vs sorafenib) showed that the response rate of LENVATINIB was 24% vs 9% of sorafenib (the approved first-line immunotherapy Atezolizumab/Avastin has a response rate of 29%). Furthermore, the most relevant adverse effect of LENVATINIB is Hypertension and not the complicated hand/foot syndrome... metrics that were not considered, although the Overall Survival in this study was not statistically significant (it was a non-inferiority study) the median OS of LENVATINIB is greater than that of sorafenib. As additional data, the cost of treatment at therapeutic doses (12 mg Lenvatinib and 800 mg sorafenib) is cheaper with LENVATINIB, we estimate that the savings for the MINSAL only by replacing the drug financed by DAC (sorafenib) would reach about 200 million per year.

The advantages it has as a first-line therapy and the favorable recommendations in the different guidelines (national and international) are highlighted. They comment that in several countries this indication is covered. In Chile, although Nivolumab is covered in DAC for second-line treatment, it is not for first-line. They request that it be recorded that they need to identify with whom they should speak so that these medications are included in the evaluation and prioritization for their inclusion in some coverage guarantee. They also mention that it be recorded that they have requested that the Head of the Cancer Department be in the lobbies, since DIPLAS informed them that the Cancer Department is the one who prioritizes.

The MINSAL reports that we have 12 patients under judicial review with eculizumab and 12 with ravulizumab and that we cannot change the judicial rulings, that we must explore the power to allocate resources to change their treatment. The laboratory mentions that eculizumab is not registered in Chile and that in the future they will not produce it because ravulizumab is clearly superior in treatment. MINSAL: we promise to coordinate a meeting with FINASA to evaluate the access alternatives and to be able to make the change. Laboratory: they promise to present access strategies and economic offers.

📄 **Meeting Highlights and Notes**  
During the meeting, the following topics and points were discussed:  
- Current regulations on approval of biological drugsTOPICS ADDRESSED AT THE MEETING:It informs that it requested a meeting to review regulatory processes associated with the approval of orphan drugs in Chile, specifically for the approval of its biotechnological product "Glofitamab" for the treatment of patients with "Diffuse lymphoma"; this due to the delay in granting its health registration and on the recommendation of ISP, to evaluate with MINSAL potential prioritizations for its authorization (References No. RF 1857723 and No. RF 1857740, both entered in May 2022).It indicates that according to current regulations, the ordinary registration regulatory processes - to which biotechnological molecules are subjected - should take 6 months, but this does not happen in reality, there being a longer period for regulatory approval and there being no clear administrative route to date that allows priority evaluation; In their view, the latter aspect is an opportunity for regulatory improvement to make processes more efficient and improve patient accessibility to more cost-effective pharmacological treatments. They state that they have studied the subject and that for 60% of the approved health registrations there is an evaluation and approval time of 22 to 32 months, according to the "WAIT" report, developed by "Fifarma" and "IQVIA", which shows that the regulatory approval processes in Chile are one of the longest in Latin America, which delays accessibility to patients. They require the prioritization and acceleration of the regulatory approval of "Glofitamab", since it addresses the therapeutic treatment where there would be no major pharmacological alternatives; while in Non-Hodgkin B-Cell Lymphoma 65% of patients are cured with current therapies, but products are required for patients who are resistant to established therapies and who fail in their initial treatments; There is a need that would be covered by “Glofitamab”, as a third-line product, which has shown a good therapeutic response immediately after treatment and which is significantly maintained afterwards, giving complete and long-lasting remissions beyond the end of treatment. They add to the above, that the referred product has already been authorized by FDA/USA and EMA/Europe, during the year 2023 and that to date there are more than 2,100 patients treated worldwide since the start of its commercialization (in addition to the patients who were treated in the respective clinical trials). Additionally, it reports that in Chile some patients have managed to receive the therapy through a coverage for "compassionate use" (8 patients), while the drug has been requested by some local doctors in a special way because it is an orphan disease. They point out that, according to what was reported by ISP, the only option to prioritize the evaluation of the sanitary registration of "Glofitamab" is for the MINSAL to establish the prioritization, by resolution, by application of the registration abbreviation referred to in article 51° of DS MINSAL N° 3/2010. They propose opportunities for improvement of the current regulation and thus have effective mechanisms for registrations of orphan drugs and therapies advanced, such as:- Allowing prioritization of evaluation of orphan drug registration, recognized by high surveillance authorities.- Extending the application of the accelerated registration procedure to biotechnological medicines, these being relevant and latest innovation products for diseases of health importance. In the case of "Glofitamab", they also propose the possible application of article 54° of DS MINSAL No. 3/2010. It is reported that as a result of regulatory modifications made to art. 51° of DS MINSAL No. 3/2010 (year 2020), the issuance of a ministerial resolution to shorten the registration procedure for products included in MINSAL plans and programs or in the National Drug Formulary is no longer necessary; but that in any case such mechanism would not be applicable to the case under review. Likewise, it is indicated that the registration acceleration route would be only prospective and its extension to biotechnological medicines is under study. However, it is reported that the MINSAL may be formally requested to urgently have the product, taking into account its usefulness in clinical cases where there are no other treatment options.

During the meeting, the following topics and points were discussed:  
- Guests: - Carolina de Pablo - Claudio Covini- Cristian Matamala - Emilia Reyes- Joaquín Pedre - Joaquín Tagle - Juan Corona - Pamela Llantén - Ramiro Cofre and Tamara Doberti. Biogen presents a risk profile for a possible shared risk agreement, they ask questions about what risk profile we need to describe from the MINSAL. The response is that specifically in AME1 we are interested in the functional results and possible combinations of therapies available for AME 1. Biogen leaves questions in chat: Would currently judicialized patients move to the possible coverage scheme? Or would they continue with their current status and the coverage scheme be for new patients exclusively? This is part of what could be discussed as part of the ARC, effectively incorporating patients already in treatment could make it more complex to establish compliance with clinical milestones. What is the current coverage criterion for a new patient with SMA type 1 who, having been proposed by their treating physician, is not a candidate for gene therapy?  Currently, MINSAL only has the acquisition and financing strategy for gene therapy with onasemnogen abaperbovec. How does the Office of Complex Chronic Conditions and Rare Diseases of DIPRECE plan to evaluate results once therapy has started? Would it be exclusively through the AD HOC Commission currently active? Evaluation by an external entity agreed upon by both parties? Would a commission be formed especially for the evaluation of results?  The best way is being explored with other countries. In general, a follow-up protocol must always be established with the milestones established in the ARC, which would be evaluated by a committee made up of people external to MINSAL. But it is also part of the ARC proposal that can be built. What is the time horizon for implementing the ARC?  We are currently working on presenting the institutional ARC proposal to the Authority as part of an ARC policy. Then we would move forward with the different providers that could make ARC.
